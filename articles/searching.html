<a href="#streamlining-your-development-ecosystem-searching-the-web-from-r" class="anchor"></a>Streamlining your Development Ecosystem: Searching the Web from R</h1>
<p>Programmers are good at engineering software and designing web applications. I argue that we can apply the same logic to facilitate an environment which provides a natural, orchestrated flow between the various activities we undertake, both online and in the console.</p>
<p>In this post I use searching the web, a process developers rely on heavily for many different reasons, as a basic example of an area for improvement.</p>
<p>I will show you some examples of querying specific search engines directly from your R console as well as provide some pre-configured functions for some of my most common use-cases.</p>
<p>Before showcasing the code, first I want to bring to light some ideas surrounding our daily workflows as developers and how we interact with the web.</p>
<div id="your-mind-is-a-cpu" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#your-mind-is-a-cpu" class="anchor"></a>Your Mind is a CPU</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The optimal number of threads in any system is one thread.” - Scott Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of your mind as a CPU (central processing unit) like that on your computer. Each separate task you pursue throughout the day relies on a limited amount of resources, which can be thought of as your bank of available<br><em>Random Access Memory</em>, or RAM.</p>
<p>From this prespective, the idea of multi-tasking becomes <em>multi-threading</em>, and as developers we all know that for computers to run asynchronous, parallel, multi-threaded processes requires a highly intricate, well designed, and deeply thought out infrastructure to work properly without overloading the CPU and crashing the machine.</p>
<p>Similarly, switching contexts between different digital environments causes your mind to have to continuously re-adjust and reboot its underlying resources in order to faciliate the influx of new information in need of being processed.</p>
<p>In other words, it takes time, energy, and resources to get your mind to focus, and every time we switch tasks or contexts, we lose energy that wouldn’t have been lost if we had just stayed in one context initially. The fatigue that builds up from all of this energy loss can potentially demotivate us, as well as cause mental burnout.</p>
<p>Programmers should strive to reach a <strong>state of flow</strong> in which complete focus can be given to one activity.</p>
<p>This requires determination and discipline in order to keep that focus streamlined as well as a proper environment which motivates focus instead of scattered, distracted thought.</p>
<p>The solution to avoiding burnout and unproductive programming habits is to provide an ecosystem where context switching is minimized and when needed, streamlined.</p>

<a href="#identifying-an-opporitunity" class="anchor"></a>Identifying an Opporitunity</h2>
<p>Have you ever wanted to search google directly from R? What about query your organizations Github repos or search for packages on your respective CRAN mirror?</p>
<p>This thought never crossed my mind until I took a second to think about the potential benefits of constructing a system for implementing this in R.</p>
<p>The problem I found was two-fold:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Searching the web for R specific resources can be frustrating, time-consuming, and difficult.</li>
<li>The process of switching contexts from R to the browser is unproductive and breaks my natural development flow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Identifying these issues, I took it as an opportunity to create something new, and potentially beneficial to others as we developers love to do.</p>
<div id="reviewing-current-processes" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#reviewing-current-processes" class="anchor"></a>Reviewing Current Processes</h3>
<p>Although most R developers are extensively familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">The DRY Principle</a> (<em>Don’t repeat yourself</em>) in programming, many do not attempt to extend the principle outside of their code.</p>
<p>Thinking on the principle further, I realized that the amount of time developers interact with the web through a web browser interface is much larger than we may think and is only growing as our dependence on online services and learning resources increase exponentially.</p>
<p>For me, the idea of searching from your command prompt or terminal stemmed from my repetitive need to search online for some form of information whilst in the midst of a programming endeavor. While there are many amazing API’s, SDK’s, and localized web-oriented frameworks allowing developers to interact with the web from their console, I found myself in need of a more general, simplistic approach to querying information hosted online from my local machine.</p>
<p>Once I stopped to think about my daily processes while developing locally and interacting with the internet, I quickly realized that there is a much larger frequency of instances where I am in need of browsing the web than I originally would have anticipated. Whether navigating to my web browser to google a new concept, review a Github pull request, or even launch a locally hosted shiny application, I found that I use my browsers constantly throughout the day.</p>
<p>To name a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing a new pull request on Github or searching my backlog of issues assigned to me</li>
<li>Searching for new software or downloading a new version</li>
<li>Searching my cloud storage drives for files or data</li>
<li>Searching my emails for important information</li>
<li>Reviewing online documentation when learning something new</li>
<li>Retrieving a forgotten API Key or account password</li>
<li>Checking on and maintaining a hosted cloud service platform</li>
<li>Watching a demo video on youtube for a new application</li>
<li>Checking my RSS feeds and developer blogs to stay up to date on current news</li>
<li>Searching google for a new library, concept, or framework</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are a variety of instances where interacting with and querying the web has become a routine in our daily development workflows and learning processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to the lack of a more streamlined, self-contained approach to this reliance on the web while programming, I found myself easily distracted my all of the bells and whistles the internet and my browsers have to offer. Between all of the bookmarks, feeds, notifications and variety of browser extensions the simple process of leaving your code and opening your browser has much larger implications than most people realize.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a minimal interruption to your programming workflow, the fact of the matter is that programming is a form of work which requires a very deep, specific environment and mindset in order to keep your development pipelines productive and efficient. In other words, programming is not easy and requires intense focus.</p>
<p>Therefore, developers should do everything they can to avoid having to switch in and out of the various shallow contexts surrounding our everyday lives while attempting to perform a session of productive coding.</p>

<div id="developing-a-simple-solution" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#developing-a-simple-solution" class="anchor"></a>Developing a Simple Solution</h2>
<p>To provide a simple, yet powerful solution to the issues surrounding browsing the internet for necessary resources, I started with my personal browser settings.</p>
<p>Most web browser providers facilitate a setting where you can configure your own custom configurations for creating search queries to specific web sites using your address bar.</p>
<p>For example, in Chrome if you navigate to Settings &gt; Manage Search Engines you will see a list of default search engine providers such as google, bing, and yahoo as well as some auto-generated engines created by websites you have visited in the past such as Youtube or Medium.</p>
<p>What most people do not realize is they can add <a href="">add their own search engines and keywords</a> also. For example, if I want to search Github repositories querying with a specific keyword while filtering for only repositories categorized with the language <em>R</em> the query URL would be: <code>https://github.com/search?q=%slanguage%3Ar</code>. You can produce this yourself by searching from Github and applying the filters yourself and replaceing the term you searched for with <code>%s</code>, simliar to the <code>sprintf</code> context. Lastly, assign a keyword of <code>ghr</code> and test it out by typing <code>ghr</code> in your address bar and pressing tab or enter. Now when you search it will direct you to Github R repositories!</p>
<p>Building on this framework I setup in my browser years ago, I decided to take it one step further by bringing the searching functionality to my personal R package <a href="https://github.com/jimbrig/jimstools">jimstools</a> focusing on R-specific search engines (it can be quite difficult to search effectively for R resources filtering out everything else given R is only one letter).</p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-the-search-engines" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#setting-up-the-search-engines" class="anchor"></a>Setting up the Search Engines</h2>
<p>For setting up the search engines all I needed to do was migrate my browser customized search engine URL’s into R by wrapping them in R functions which pass the <code>%s</code> syntax as a function argument.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the search engines I have implemented so far and their functions:</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#r" class="anchor"></a>R</h2>
<p>Although I do use other terminals, languages, and shells outside of the R environment, most of my development work is done within R and RStudio. Therefore, I chose R as my framework for implementing a set of utility functions to quickly perform advanced search queries online from a wide variety of search engine source domains.</p>
