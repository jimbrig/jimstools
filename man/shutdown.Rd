function uses it to shut down a computer.

0} (for Windows) or \command{shutdown -h now} to shut down the computer.

if (interactive()) {
# when your code is extremely time-consuming, you may need this function; e.g. you go to sleep, and R is running long computation... complex graphics... and long long computation... at last,
shutdown()
# the next day you wake up, "thank you, R" :)
